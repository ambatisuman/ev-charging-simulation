# ev-charging-simulation

React requires Node.js to run, as it uses Node.js for the development server and package management.

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

Ensure that npm (Node Package Manager) is also installed, as they come bundled with Node.js.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:ambatisuman/ev-charging-simulation.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   ```bash
   cd ev-charging-simulation
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the Development Server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Open in Browser**
   Open your web browser and navigate to the URL displayed in the terminal (typically `http://localhost:5173`)

## Troubleshooting
